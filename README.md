# AW2 | Retexture Templates

Decided to provide retexture templates for editing your own. All files are in PSD (Adobe Photoshop). If you're new to texture modding or modding Alan Wake 2, please consult the [Alan Wake 2 Modding Wiki](https://github.com/Modding-Haven/AW2-Modding-Documentation/wiki). Currently, I'm adding things as I go along.
